# python3-CAA-A-records-dynv6
Create, update and get your CAA and A records for dynv6.

## Info
Some code written for fun, to see if you can get the job done with only DNS and SSH, in case of the updater. The record fetcher and CAA record creator are just basic requests with JSON to keep things simple.
